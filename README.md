# Introduction
Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide. Early and precise diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and improving patient outcomes. Potentialy improve diagnostic tools and assist healthcare professionals in decision-making.

## **Dataset Overview**
The **[CBIS-DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/cbis-ddsm-breast-cancer-image-dataset/data)** is a large-scale dataset used for **breast cancer diagnosis**, particularly focusing on **mammography images**. It is available on **Kaggle**, and it provides images along with annotations that are essential for training and evaluating machine learning models for tasks such as **tumor classification** (benign vs. malignant) and **lesion detection** in breast tissue.

The CBIS-DDSM dataset is a curated subset of the **Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM)**. It was specifically curated for **breast cancer detection** using mammography images and contains both **mammogram images** and corresponding **annotations**.
